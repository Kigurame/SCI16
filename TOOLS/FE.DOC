 Mark Wilden					8 January 1992

 Fixed bug that trashed character or locked up if you click quickly and
 frequently in non-edit area of edit window.

 Ver 2.210

 Mark Wilden					28 December 1992

 After increasing number of characters in font, the added characters were
 garbagy, instead of being solid black blocks.
 
 Added merging capability:  if a file to be opened has fewer characters than
 the current file, it can optionally have the extra characters from the current
 file added to it.
