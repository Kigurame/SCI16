VOL1:\PUBLIC\TOOLS\DRIVERS\NON_SHIP (X:DRIVERS\NON_SHIP)
--------------------------------------------------------

The drivers in this directory are either:

   1) obsolete, but we want to keep copies to support older games
   2) not popular enough to justify shipping with every game, but
         available for the BBS's

None of these drivers should be shipped with a game.
