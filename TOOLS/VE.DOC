4/30/92  a new version of the View Editor (2.11) is now on the net.
This version fixes a bug caused when users adjust the size of a cel
to 0 or pull the lower right corner higher than the upper left
corner.  In addition it fixes a problem with when importing a cel
from a picture.  That process would change color 16 (10 hex) to skip
color.  If there are any problems created by this change, please let
me (Ken Koch) know.
