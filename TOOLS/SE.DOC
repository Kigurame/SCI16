A 'cel tag' is now assigned to each cel.  You can click on the tag to change
it's setting.  Tags can be 3 characters long but only the first character is
significant.  Specifying a tag causes that cel to become the default sync
setting and also adds a new sync mark 'space sync' ticks after the current
sync (if there is room).

A new menu item uder SYNC called 'Tag New Sync' and 'Tag Current Sync'
toggles between adding a new sync or modifying the current sync (respectively)
whenever keying-in a cels tag.

Clicking in the graph window now has the following effect:
  if the play setting is something like |30> for example then
  left clicking will play 30 ticks from the point-of-click onwards
  and right clicking will play 30 ticks prior and upto the point-
  of-click.  To reverse this functionality set <30| instead.
  A setting such as <30> will play 15 ticks before and after the
  point-of-click, right or left.
  If control-clicking, '<' is treated as beggining of window and '>'
  is treated as end of window.

The warning message that occurred when a sync was added too close to an
existing sync has been removed.

Press 'ENTER' to playback a segment per the current sync and <30> setting.

Safety check put in to space cels that are very thin.
