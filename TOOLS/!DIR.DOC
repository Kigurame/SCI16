VOL1:\PUBLIC\TOOLS (X:)
-----------------------

The files in this directory are used during the development of a game.  Most
are built by Sierra.  Since they are development tools, they may change in
form and/or function as game resources change.

Therefore, when a game is shipped (or its system is frozen), this entire
directory should be copied into a PROG\TOOLS directory in the game's
directory structure.

The files in this directory are periodically maintained and updated, and the
housekeeping of this directory is the responsibility of Game Services. 
Obsolete files are routinely archived and removed.
